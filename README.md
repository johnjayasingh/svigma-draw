# Svigma

This project was created based on a idea i got from seeing a small clip in fireship video. Explain SVG under 100 seconds.

I had a issue earlier that is to draw lines polygons rectanges and circles in a ReactJs application.

I solved it using canvas and wondered how its done in Figma alway.

This pet project i did with the idea i got.

Hope to improve this a bit more when ever i get time and make a complete tool that can draw svg in ReactJS.

I don't know if its already done by some one in a better way. But anyway :)

## Steps

Just clone this repository do `npm install` and `npm start` to run the project.
